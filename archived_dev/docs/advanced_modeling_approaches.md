## Dataset Characteristics
- 189K samples
- 280 features
- Severe class imbalance
- Strong temporal dependencies
- 69 temporal/rolling features

## 1. Deep Learning Models

### Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN)
- **Why**: Strong sequential patterns in temporal features
- **Advantages**: Better long-range dependency capture than RNNs, handles variable-length sequences
- **Implementation**: Dilated convolutions for different time scales

### Transformer-based Architecture
- **Why**: Self-attention identifies influential past games
- **Advantages**: Parallel processing, interpretable attention weights
- **Key**: Positional encoding for game sequence

### Neural Network with Entity Embeddings
- **Why**: Learn dense representations for categorical features
- **Advantages**: Captures player-specific tendencies
- **Implementation**: 32-64 dimensional player embeddings

## 2. Advanced Ensemble Methods

### LightGBM with Custom Objectives
```python
def focal_loss_objective(y_true, y_pred):
    alpha, gamma = 0.25, 2.0
    p = 1.0 / (1.0 + np.exp(-y_pred))
    # Custom focal loss for extreme imbalance
```

### CatBoost
- **Why**: Superior categorical feature handling
- **Advantages**: Built-in target encoding, ordered boosting
- **Features**: Automatic interaction detection, GPU support

### Stacking with Meta-Learning
- **Level 1**: XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, Neural Net, ExtraTrees
- **Level 2**: Bayesian Ridge or Elastic Net meta-learner
- **Key**: Out-of-fold predictions to prevent overfitting

## 3. Probabilistic Models

### Gradient Boosting with NGBoost
- **Why**: Full probability distributions
- **Advantages**: Uncertainty quantification, calibrated probabilities
- **Output**: Mean, variance, confidence intervals

### Bayesian Neural Networks
- **Why**: Quantifies epistemic uncertainty
- **Implementation**: MC Dropout or variational inference
- **Benefit**: Distinguishes uncertain vs confident predictions

## 4. Specialized Architectures

### Hierarchical Models
- Player-level random effects
- Global model with player-specific adjustments
- Requires minimum samples per player

### Multi-Task Learning
- **Tasks**: HR probability, XBH probability, Launch angle
- **Architecture**: Shared feature extraction, task-specific heads
- **Benefit**: Auxiliary tasks provide additional training signal

## 5. Feature Engineering Enhancements

### Automated Feature Learning
- Deep Feature Synthesis with Featuretools
- Entity relationships between games and players
- Automated aggregation and transformation primitives

### Learned Embeddings Pipeline
- Word2Vec for pitcher matchup embeddings
- Ballpark embeddings (16 dimensions)
- Sequential learning from game histories

## 6. Calibration & Post-Processing

### Platt Scaling with Cross-Validation
```python
from sklearn.calibration import CalibratedClassifierCV
calibrated_clf = CalibratedClassifierCV(
    base_estimator=your_model,
    method='sigmoid',
    cv=TimeSeriesSplit(n_splits=5)
)
```

### Conformal Prediction
- Prediction intervals with guaranteed coverage
- Essential for risk management in betting

## 7. Implementation Priority

### Immediate Impact (1-2 days)
- LightGBM with focal loss for imbalance
- Isotonic calibration on existing XGBoost

### Medium Term (1 week)
- CatBoost for categorical handling
- Stacking ensemble with diverse models

## 8. Validation Strategies

### Time-Based Cross-Validation
```python
class BlockingTimeSeriesSplit:
    def __init__(self, n_splits=5, purge_days=7, embargo_days=7):
        self.n_splits = n_splits
        self.purge_days = purge_days  # Remove data around split
        self.embargo_days = embargo_days  # Gap after train set
```

### Player-Stratified Validation
- Representative player distribution in each fold
- Hold out entire players for generalization testing
- Nested CV for model and hyperparameter selection

### Betting-Specific Metrics
- ROI (Return on Investment)
- Sharpe Ratio
- Maximum Drawdown
- Hit Rate at Threshold

### Production Monitoring
- Prediction drift tracking
- Feature importance stability
- A/B testing against production
- Daily calibration metrics

## Key Implementation Considerations

1. **Handle Class Imbalance**: SMOTE-Tomek, focal loss, or class weights
2. **Feature Selection**: SHAP values to identify/remove noisy features
3. **Ensemble Diversity**: Ensure different error patterns in base models
4. **Calibration**: Critical for accurate betting probabilities
5. **Computational Efficiency**: Consider inference time for live betting
